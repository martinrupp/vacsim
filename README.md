## What is this?
This is the as-simple-as-possible programming game i came up with. Design goals:

having a fun programming game
should be very easy to use. no download, no log in
should be easy to build

So that's the result. A browser-based programming game where you have to program a simulated
vacuum cleaner robot with javascript.
